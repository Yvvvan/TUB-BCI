    "A simple way of modeling the effect a change in conductivity between two homogeneous subspaces is the so-called \"method of images\": it can be used to solve the internal field of the source subspace by a superposition of the partial solution and a homogeneous solution. The electrical field/potential of a source distribution outside of the subspace is  homogeneous within and can be used to generate correct boundary conditions. This is then added to the partial solution to get correct boundary conditions. \n",

Measuring the remaining resonance after a certain time can lead to insights on the composition of the matter under study.\n",

The second dimension is defined by the direction from the center between the two pre-auricular points (called the intra-auricular point) to the nasal point (on the nose between the eyes).
